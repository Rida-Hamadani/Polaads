# Polaads -- Polynomials as a Data Structure

This package will facilitate computations related to polynomials.
My main focus here is arithmetic computations, such as gcd and factorization.

Currently, polynomials are defined through the field, map<Integer, Integer>. I plan in the near future to replace this with Polynomial&lt;T extends Ring&gt; to achieve more generality and make this package applicable to more use cases.
